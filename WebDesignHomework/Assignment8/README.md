<p>I used the "div" function to group my sections titled "My Personal Picks" and "Community Favorites".  I also used the "div" function to make sure the trailers and images are neat and ordered. </p>
<br />
<p>I used the "span" function to make the movie and tv show titles be bold and stand out more for the users.</p>
<br />
<p>I used the "video" function for the Smile trailer to make it easier for users to view the trailer for the recommendation.</p>
<br />
<p>I used the "iframe" function by implementing movie and tv show trailers for each recommendation that way users do not have to go out of their way to search the trailer elsewhere.</p>
<br />
<p>I used "class" functions in ways such as .media in order to embed certain trailers and by using these "class" functions, the consistentcy and cleanliness of the website is well done.</p>
<br />
<p>I used the escape character "&mdash" in order to render across browsers in a correct way.  It also adds to the neatness of the website.</p>
