<h1>Website Idea One</h1>
<h2>Favorite Sports Team</h2>

<p>I have an idea about a website where it's centered around your favorite sports team.  Let's take the New York Yankees for example and once you select the Yankees as your favorite team, the webpage will then show every single aspect of that team imaginable.  The web page will show everything from the scores of their previous games to their upcoming games.  It will also show promotions for each game and links to help guide people that are not from the area who are planning to come to the games in order to make sure the user is not going down a rabbit hole to find things.  I would make the tone something to reflect all things centered around the team so that being said, I would say the tone would be semi professional while being fun at the same time.</p>

<h1>Website Idea Two</h1>
<h2>Personal Blog about Myself</h2>

<p>For the next website, I would do a personal blog about my life.  I would post about some of the important things going on in my life, ask questions, and try and connect with the users of the website as best I can.  I would keep the tone of this website definitely light and fun.</p>

<h1>Website Idea Three</h1>
<h2>Movie and TV Show review</h2>

<p>For the final website idea, I would consider a website where I would review different movies and tv shows.  How it could work is I look at the upcoming movies and tv shows and agree to watch and review them but I would also have an option for people to give me recommendations on things to watch.  The tone of this website would for sure be easy going and just a place for people to escape the world for a bit and enjoy some entertainment content.</p>
