<h1>Why I Chose my Website Ideas</h1>

<h2>Favorite Sports Team</h2>
<p>I chose this idea because I am someone who is an avid sports fan living outside of the areas where my teams reside.  I dont get to go many games but whenever I can, having a website where everything I need as within one website would be quite nice.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Personal Blog about Myself</h2>
<p>I chose this idea because I'm an extroverted person and I like interacting with people. This website would be a fun way to show off aspects of my life and have a good time.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Movie and TV Show review</h2>
<p>I chose this idea because I have always been a big movie/tv show watcher and I enjoy hearing what other people have to say about it.  This could be a fun little way to interact with people on their recommendations and to stay committed to watching something all the way through.</p>
