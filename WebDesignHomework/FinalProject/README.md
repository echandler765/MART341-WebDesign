# Project: D1 College Basketball Website

This project is a website dedicated to the 2024-2025 Division 1 College Basketball season. It fulfills the specified requirements by implementing modern web development techniques to ensure usability, readability, and responsiveness.

## Features and Implementation Details

### 1. **Three or More Pages**
   - **Implementation:** The website includes three pages:
     - `index7.html`: The homepage.
     - `favorites2.html`: Highlights the top teams favored to win the championship.
     - `transfers2.html`: Lists top player transfers for the season.
   - **Reasoning:** Multiple pages improve the user experience by organizing content into logical sections.

### 2. **Clear, Well-Organized Layout with Strong Usability**
   - **Implementation:** Bootstrap is used for layout consistency, with a navigation bar for easy page switching. Semantic HTML tags enhance accessibility.
   - **Reasoning:** A clear layout improves navigation, making the website more user-friendly.

### 3. **Use of an External Stylesheet**
   - **Implementation:** A dedicated CSS file (`ncaa2.css`) handles custom styles, such as typography, spacing, and element styling.
   - **Reasoning:** Centralizing styles in one file ensures maintainability and a consistent look across pages.

### 4. **Apply at Least One Font**
   - **Implementation:** The Google Font "Roboto" is used throughout the website for a modern, clean aesthetic.
   - **Reasoning:** Using a custom font enhances visual appeal and sets the tone of the site.

### 5. **At Least One Image**
   - **Implementation:** Placeholder images are included on each page to represent content visually.
   - **Reasoning:** Images improve user engagement and provide context for the content.

### 6. **At Least One Embedded Media Element**
   - **Implementation:** A YouTube video is embedded on each page as a highlight reel for user engagement.
   - **Reasoning:** Media elements enrich the user experience by adding dynamic, engaging content.

### 7. **Structural and Semantic HTML Markup with Clean Layout**
   - **Implementation:** The project uses semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.
   - **Reasoning:** Semantic HTML improves accessibility for screen readers and search engines.

### 8. **Legible, Well-Commented, and Error-Free Code**
   - **Implementation:** Inline comments explain the purpose of key sections in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The code is validated to be error-free.
   - **Reasoning:** Comments make the code easier to understand and maintain for future developers.
