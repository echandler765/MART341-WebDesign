<p>I chose this idea because I have always been a big movie/tv show watcher and I enjoy hearing what other people have to say about it.  This website idea could be a fun way to watch some good shows/movies and to interact with people.  The tone of this website would definitely be easy-going and calm.  The idea for this website is to give users a way to escape the real world and to dive into some entertainment content while providing useful feedback on movies/tv shows.</p>

<p>Adjusting the width and the background color helped make the webpage a lot easier to use and the layout was clear and concise.  I did my best to utilize the whitespace to improve the flow of the website and make the webpage easier to navigate.</p>

<p>The final design was what I was hoping for but I definitely had to make some adjustments along the way.  I wasn't quite sure how the design would look in motion but I am satisfied with how it turned out. Messing with the different background colors and width of elements made it difficult to make the website visually appealing.</p>

<p>Experimenting with float and margin was a frustrating experience but I got it to work.  I had to mess with it over and over again which was annoying but I figured it out.</p>

<p>I didn't have too many issues other than trial and error.  The balancing problems were also the same as in I just did trial and error until it worked.  Overall, I wouldn't consider the problems I encountered too severe.</p>
