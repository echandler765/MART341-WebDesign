### Required Techniques
1. **External CSS Style Sheet**  
   - Created a `styles.css` file in the `css/` directory to style all pages. This approach allows consistent styling across the website and easier maintenance of my design elements.

2. **Hover Effects**  
   - Applied to buttons and links to enhance user activity. For instance, buttons change color when hovered, providing feedback to users about my clickable elements.

3. **Self-hosted Font**  
   - Used a custom font hosted in the `fonts/` folder to add unique typography for headings. This self-hosted approach reduces reliance on external servers, increasing performance.

4. **Font from a Library**  
   - Incorporated **Roboto** from Google Fonts to give a good style for the body text across the website.

### Additional Techniques
1. **Font Styles and Font Weight Adjustments**  
   - Experimented with font styles for the headings and emphasized text, creating a visual hierarchy that guides users' attention to the important sections.

2. **Text Decoration**  
   - Added underlines to the main headings and removed default underlines from links to provide a cleaner look.

3. **Spacing Adjustments**  
   - Adjusted letter-spacing and line-height to improve readability and provide a balanced, open layout.

4. **Text Alignment**  
   - Centered headers and main body content for a clean, uniform, balanced look. This alignment enhances readability and gives a nice layout.

5. **Pseudo-elements and Pseudo-classes**  
   - Used pseudo-classes like `:hover` for good styles on hover and pseudo-elements like `::before` and `::after` on buttons.
