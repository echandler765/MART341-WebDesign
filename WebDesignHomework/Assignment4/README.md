A web browser is a software program used to access the internet from a device.  Web browsers behind the scenes use the rendering engine, browser engine, network, programming language (generally Javascript), and data storage in order to provide a user interface for the user to use.

The Document Object Model is an interface to a document and stipulates how that document is accessed and changed by defining its structure in a logical way.  The Document Object Model allows web pages to update dynamically without refreshing the page.

What sets these markup languages apart is that HTML is used for displaying content on the web, XML is used for data storage, and XHTML is combines aspects from HTML and XML and has much stricter rules for correct operation.

Every HTML page needs a document type, root element, head element, and body element.

The purpose for the index.html page is that it's the default landing page for a website and it is placed within the root element.

The top naming practices for clean code are descriptive words, not abbreviating, being consistent, and being specific.
